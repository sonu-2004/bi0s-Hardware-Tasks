# grep_it
I downloaded the file given. The description was 'find the flag in the junk file', so I thought I need to open the file and find in it. I opened the file in notepad and found the flag.
I think we can also find the flag in linux(ubuntu) too. It should be like using 'grep' command in terminal to find the flag. That's why the task name is grep_it.
I learned to find some text or anything in a given file.

# Dots&Dashes
I downloaded the file given. As the description of task was to decrypt it, I searched in google for a audio file decoder and got into 'Morse Code Adaptive Audio Decoder' where I uploaded the file given in the challenge and decoded it. I found at the end of the decoded text it was 'C T F ...(some text)', I copied the text and pasted it as the flag. Then I removed all spaces and submitted as in the format of the flag.

# Ceasercipher
I just googled caesercipher and pasted the text given in it and gave the key as 10 because if we add 10 after 'w'(the first letter of flag format) we get 'g'(1st letter given in the text) and got the flag as like the format. I copied the flag and submitted it.

# Lifetimesettlement
First as I saw the string with 1s and 0s so I thought it might be binary and tried to decode it I couldn't get the flag. Then I thought it should be some type of cipher, after trial and error method identified that it was spoon type cipher. Got the flag and submitted it.

# da_french_cipher
Initially I tried with caesercipher but couldn't get the flag. Suddenly the name of the task gave me a idea to try with french cipher, so got into vignere cipher where I pasted the text and gave the key as 'AEIOU' as it was given as hint in the task to use vowels as key. After decoding I got the flag and submitted it
